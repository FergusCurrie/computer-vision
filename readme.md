# Deep Learning Research Implementations. 

This repository contains implementations of deep learning research. The goal of this repository is to improve my understanding of deep learning and to provide a resource for others who are interested in learning about deep learning. 

This is still very much in its early stages. I'm still figuring out what data/eval to use, how to deal with large parameter models etc.
